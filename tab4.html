                    No one knows what their future holds other than the lord of the entire universe, He knows what our future holds and No doubt He will give us a future He deems fit but Allah judges a future on
                    the actions and heart of the person, I believe that you will have an amazing future and im praying always that you get a future where you are surrounded by only blessings of Allah.
                    No doubt you will have a fulfilling future and i'll always will be praying only for a future in which you are the most blessed and may you always be.

                    I envision a future for you that is filled with just love,care,blessings,comfort and fulfillment.I see a future where you smile the most and your happiness is protected where 
                    you don't cry in front of Allah due to sadness or hurt but instead you will cry infront of Allah due to gratitude for the blessings and ease that Allah will definitely provide for you.
                    I see you as a very very successful person in the future who Allah blesses with not only just wealth but also with abundent respect and honour. INSHAALLAH when people will talk about you
                    or think of you they will think of you with admiration and unbelievable amount of respect and they will all testify to the unhindered strength of your character. You will smile,you will be happy,
                    you will have all the peace a human needs, you will have all the love and care an amazing human like you deserve and i pray that success and safety will always be a constant in your life.

                <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px; font-family: roboto; font-size: 22px;">
                    I hope that I am with you through out this journey with you and I can provide you with that love and care you deserve but this is just a prayer and desire from my heart and i cannot be certain If Allah plan's for me 
                    to be with you always so I pray everyday for a future with you and for a hereafter with you only. If Allah's plan for you a future without me then I pray that future holds more happiness than that I could ever give you.
