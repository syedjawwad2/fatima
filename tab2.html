                    Your love is more valuable than all the riches in the world combined. Your love for your family, your parents, sisters, brother and Allah is a type of love I had never seen before it taught me how to love others as well.
                    I learned how to love my sisters and mother through you and your love for your family. Everyone who has your love is unbelieveably blessed in this world, they have literally earned heavens treasure in this whole world.Your love has no limit, I feel if
                    there was a representation of infinity in this world then it would be your love for your family and Allah.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px; font-family: roboto; font-size: 22px;">
                    Allah has filled your heart with so much love and you have returned all that love to Him and i believe He blesses you so much and puts you through
                    all his tests because of the love you show to Allah.You consult Allah for all that you do, You ask only Allah for help, You only cry infront of Allah
                    and only to Him do you seek your desire and your will to do good which is love that guides me and everyone who knows you to learn how to truly love Allah.
                    I believe , without a doubt ,Allah loves you the most.
                </p>

                    Your love for your siblings is truly remarkable ,to always support them and to see good in them, caring for their hearts and emotions and even sacrificing your own wants and desires for them
                    is the highest form of love. Your love for your parents is admirable, You worry for them and cry while praying for them, you wait for their arrival and treat them with the love they have treated you with
                    . Your care and worry for me is not overlooked by me at all, i consider that a blessing for me and im eternally grateful to Allah tha i was blessed with your love and I value it more than anything in this world.
