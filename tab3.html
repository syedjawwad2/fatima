                    I cant bare thinking of you being sad to the extent that even the thought of you crying because of someone or because of me just shakes me to my core.
                    Sadness is unfortunately a part of our human lives and i believe sadness is necessary to give happiness it's value but I pray always that in your life 
                    the scale of happiness is heavier than sadness.Your sadness is heavy,it's consuming and it's all consuming but all that does not scare me away from you nor 
                    does it scare me away from praying for a future with you.Instead I just want to be there for you when you get sad, I don't want
                    you to ever be alone in sadness. 
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px; font-family: roboto; font-size: 22px;">
                    I hope if you ever feel burdened by sadness, you come to me so i can be there to face it with you.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px; font-family: roboto; font-size: 22px;">
                    when you are sad you keep it to yourself in an effort to not burden anyone else and not to take sympathy, I admire your commitment to staying strong
                    but I hope you find it in you to share your sadness with me, I do not want you to be so strong always I want you to relief yourself from your sadness
                    through me. 
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px; font-family: roboto; font-size: 22px;">
                    You are the most important and valuable person to me even when you feel sad or down.I want all your emotions and I want to be there through all the storms that stur
                    in your beautiful heart.I pray that sadness never changes you, I pray i can stay beside you through everything always, I pray i can become your emotional anchor
                    in this world and hereafter. 
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px; font-family: roboto; font-size: 22px;">
                    your sadness is as beautiful as you.
